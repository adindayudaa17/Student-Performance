# Student-Performance
This project aims to predict student performance using data from the UCI ML Repository. I applied Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost regressors. Models were evaluated using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 Score to compare accuracy and analyze key factors affecting academic outcomes.
